# P2
P2! Developed by Jessica(Optimization Lead), Jonathan (Visualization Lead), Justis (GitHub Admin/Owner, Team Lead), Patrick(Co-Admin/Lead).

# Prompt
Create a Spark Application that process data(choose your data).

Size of data should be 2k and above,and a minimum 3 tables.

Your project  should involve useful analysis of data(Every concept of spark like rdd, dataframes, sql, dataset and optimization methods  and  persistence should be included). The Expected output is different trends that you have observed as part of data collectivley and how you can use these trends to make some useful decisions.

Should have admin and normal user access with password set in database along with Visualization  for out put 

Let the P2, have presentation with screen shots and practical demo.

# Trends
Age: (A)What are the trends across the age continuum effect the fatality rate of riders/drivers vs pedestrians? Essentially, what ages are most likely to die inside the car, and what ages are most likely to die outside of the car? Are they the same, do the trends have any similarities?
Big Picture: (B) Graph the trend of fatalities in entire USA, (C) then graph the trend of fatalities in individual states. What are the differences, do they all have the same basic movement upward and downwards? (D) Which states are safest (could be cross referenced with states with high public transport use to find correlation)?
Rural vs Urban: (E)(F)Combine rural state data together and urban state data together, compare graphed trends (specifically death rates of vehicle types, and overall death rates across time).
Vehicle: (G)(H)Find which vehicles are most dangerous to be around (kill passengers) vs most dangerous to be inside.

#THINGS WE GOTTA DO
TODO Every concept of spark like rdd, dataframes, sql, dataset and optimization methods  and  persistence should be included.
TODO Username and password implementation (MySQL or document in spark-warehouse)
